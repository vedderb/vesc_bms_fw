** ChibiOS/RT port for Atmel AVR ATTiny167.                                **
*****************************************************************************

** TARGET **

The demo runs on a Digispark Pro board based on an ATtiny167.

** The Demo **

A thread is used to print a message to the UART. The UART pins, must be
connected to an FTDI converter to see the message on a computer. The thread
also toggles the onboard test/status LED every second, the LED is connected
to the PB1 pin of the ATtiny167 MCU wich corresponds to P1 on the
Digispark Pro board.

** Build Procedure **

The demo was built using the GCC AVR toolchain.
It should build with WinAVR too!
Just run the command "make" to build this example.

** Programming procedure **

The ATtiny167 is pre-programmed with a bootloader.
Thus it can act as an USB device.
The Digispark Pro runs the “micronucleus” bootloader.
This bootloader comes with a command line tool which can be used to
program the board.
Form more details, look at the Makefile or the github repository:
