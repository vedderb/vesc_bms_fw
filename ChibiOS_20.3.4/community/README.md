#### Using

Default makefiles assume this repo will be cloned in the same folder as ChibiOS.  
If you use another location, you will have to edit the Makefile, or specify an alternate location to make, ie:  

```
cd ChibiOS-Contrib/testhal/STM32/STM32F3xx/TIMCAP
make CHIBIOS=~/src/ChibiOS
```

A good way to use it is to clone it as a submodule inside your project:  

```
git submodule add https://github.com/ChibiOS/ChibiOS.git
git submodule add https://github.com/ChibiOS/ChibiOS-Contrib.git
```

#### Contributing
