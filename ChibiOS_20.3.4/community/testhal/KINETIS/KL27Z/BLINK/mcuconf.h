/* Boot sequence, page 88 of manual:
 * - If the NMI/BOOTCFG0 input is high or the NMI function is disabled in FTFA_FOPT, the CPU begins execution at the PC location.
 * - If the NMI/BOOTCFG0 input is low, the NMI function is enabled in FTFA_FOPT, and FTFA_FOPT[BOOTPIN_OPT] = 1, this results in an NMI interrupt. The processor executes an Exception Entry and reads the NMI interrupt handler address from vector-table offset 8. The CPU begins execution at the NMI interrupt handler.
 * - When FTFA_FOPT[BOOTPIN_OPT] = 0, it forces boot from ROM if NMI/BOOTCFG0 pin set to 0.
 *
 * Observed behaviour:
 * - when BOOTPIN_OPT=0, BOOTSRC_SEL still matters:
 *   - if 0b11 (from ROM), it still boots from ROM, even if BOOTCFG0 pin
 *     is high/floating, but leaves ROM and runs user app after
 *     5 seconds delay.
 *   - if 0b00 (from FLASH), reset/powerup jumps to user app unless
 *     BOOTCFG0 pin is asserted.
 * - in any case, reset when in bootloader induces the 5 second delay
 *   before starting the user app.
