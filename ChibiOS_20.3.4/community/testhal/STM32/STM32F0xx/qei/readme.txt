** ChibiOS/HAL - qei driver demo for STM32F0xx.                            **
*****************************************************************************

** TARGET **

The demo runs on an ST STM32F0-Discovery board.

** The Demo **

The application demonstrates the use of the STM32F0xx QEI encoder driver.

** Board Setup **

To use demo you have to connect an encoder to one of the timers that support 
the encoder mode to ch1 and ch2 and add an external pullup resistor to 3V3.
For good results add 100n capacitors to GND.
