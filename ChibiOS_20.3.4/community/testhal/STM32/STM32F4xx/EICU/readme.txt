** ChibiOS/RT HAL - 1-Wire driver demo for STM32F4xx.                      **
*****************************************************************************

** TARGET **

The demo will on an STMicroelectronics STM32F4-Discovery board.

** The Demo **

The application demonstrates the use of the STM32F4xx 1-Wire driver.

** Board Setup **

To use demo you have to power your 1-wire device from 5V bus on board
and connect DQ line to PB0 pin. Do not forget about external pullup
resistor to 5V (4k7 recommended).

** Build Procedure **

The demo has been tested using the free Codesourcery GCC-based toolchain
and YAGARTO.
Just modify the TRGT line in the makefile in order to use different GCC ports.
