** TARGET **

The demo runs on an STM32F407 Discovery board REV C or later.

** The Demo **

The application demonstrates the use of the STM32F4xx SPI driver in order
to acquire data from LIS3DSH using ChibiOS/EX.

** Board Setup **

None required.

** Build Procedure **

The demo has been tested using the free Codesourcery GCC-based toolchain
and YAGARTO.
Just modify the TRGT line in the makefile in order to use different GCC ports.
