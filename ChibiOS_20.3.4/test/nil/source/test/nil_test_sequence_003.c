 * @page nil_test_003_001 [3.1] Thread Sleep functionality
 *
 * <h2>Description</h2>
 * The functionality of @p chThdSleep() and derivatives is tested.
 *
 * <h2>Test Steps</h2>
 * - [3.1.1] The current system time is read then a sleep is performed
 *   for 100 system ticks and on exit the system time is verified
 *   again.
 * - [3.1.2] The current system time is read then a sleep is performed
 *   for 100000 microseconds and on exit the system time is verified
 *   again.
 * - [3.1.3] The current system time is read then a sleep is performed
 *   for 100 milliseconds and on exit the system time is verified
 *   again.
 * - [3.1.4] The current system time is read then a sleep is performed
 *   for 1 second and on exit the system time is verified again.
 * - [3.1.5] Function chThdSleepUntil() is tested with a timeline of
 *   "now" + 100 ticks.
