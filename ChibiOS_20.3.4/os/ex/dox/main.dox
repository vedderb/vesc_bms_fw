 * @defgroup EX EX
 * @brief   EXternal peripherals.
 * @details Under ChibiOS the set of the complex device driver interfaces 
 * dedicated to external peripherals is called the EX subsystem. The EX resides 
 * on top of EX and is actually a set of libraries for external devices like
 * MEMS, Displays, Flash memories and so on. These libraries are the 
 * implementation of one or more Abstract Interfaces brought by EX subsystem.
 * EX also relies on EX normal drivers to interface the peripherals.
 *
 * @section ex_complex_drivers_architecture EX Complex Drivers Architecture
 * Each EX driver can be considered as a standalone Complex Device Driver. For 
 * ease of use these drivers are grouped by vendor:
 * - Bosch Devices
 * - STMicroelectronics Devices
 * .
 *
 * @section bosch_devices Bosch Devices
 * This section contains all the drivers of devices produced by Bosch. 
 * Devices currently supported are MEMS and are:
 *   - @b BMP085: Digital pressure sensor;
 * .
 *
 * @section stmicroelectronics_devices STMicroelectronics Devices
 * This section contains all the drivers of devices produced by
 * STMicroelectronics. Devices currently supported are MEMS and are:
 *   - @b HTS221: Capacitive digital humidity sensor;
 *   - @b L3GD20: 3-axis digital gyroscope; 
 *   - @b LIS3DSH: 3-axis digital motion sensor;
 *   - @b LIS3MDL: Ultra low power, high performances 3-axis magnetometer;
 *   - @b LIS302DL: 3-axis motion sensor;
 *   - @b LPS25H: Piezoresistive 260-1260 hPa pressure sensor; 
 *   - @b LSM6DS0: 6-axis iNEMO inertial module; 
 *   - @b LSM303DLHC: Ultra compact high performance e-compass;
 * .
